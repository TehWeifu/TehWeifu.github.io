            <h2>Happy Birthday Michèle!!!</h2>

            <p>Hello Michèle, welcome to your website.</p>
            <p>First of all, happy birthday. I hope you and your loved ones are doing well and have a great day.</p>
            <p>I really wanted to make something special for today, thought about writing you a letter or gifting you
                something but wasn't really convinced about those ideas. I feel like the best gift I can possibly make
                you is still trying my best everyday and that is where the idea of building this website came from.</p>
            <p>This website is made so you have a place you can browse whenever you are bored or just want to cheer up a
                bit. I really hope you enjoy it, at least as much as I enjoyed developing this for you.</p>

                    <p>This was the main idea for the website, a place where you can discover recipes and get new ideas,
                        or just spam the refresh button trying to find something that piques your curiosity.</p>

                    <p>Simple and personal version of the game. I did not manage to make a proper AI that played decently, but
                        you can play with friends by sharing screens or just try to the highest score you can.</p>

                    <p>I also decided to include a small gallery with pictures and videos. They are some memories or
                        just nice things I have been wanting to share with you.</p>

                    <p>This is not related to the website itself but I have been working on a Discord Bot over the past
                        few months. It has some nice commands that you can have fun with so if you want to check it out,
                        you can add it to your server clicking the button above.</p>
