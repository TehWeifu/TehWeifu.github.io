            <h2>Get well soon, Michèle!!!</h2>

            <p>Hello Michèle, welcome to your website.</p>
            <p>First of all, I wish you an easy recovery, and you feel better soon. I also hope your kitties and your
                loved ones are doing alright</p>
            <p>I originally made this website for your birthday, so you have a place you can browse whenever you are
                bored or just want to cheer up a bit. I really hope you enjoy it, at least as much as I enjoyed making
                this for you.</p>
            <p>I really wanted to make something special for that day, thought about writing you a letter or gifting you
                something but wasn't really convinced about those ideas. I feel like the best gift I can possibly make
                you is still trying my best every day and that is where the idea of developing this website came
                from.</p>
            <p>These are the three main options plus an extra one, they are independent of each other, so feel free to
                explore them in whichever order you feel like:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>This was the main idea for the website, a place where you can discover recipes and get new ideas,
                        or just spam the refresh button trying to find something that piques your curiosity.</p>

                    <p>I also wanted to make you our own version of the game we used to play. I did not manage to make a
                        proper AI that played decently, but you can play with friends by sharing screens or just try to
                        get the highest score you can.</p>

                    <p>Finally, decided to include a small gallery with pictures and videos. They are some memories or
                        just nice things I have been wanting to share with you.</p>

                    <p>This is not related to the website itself, but I have been working on a Discord Bot over the past
                        few months. It has some nice commands that you can have fun with so if you want to check it out,
                        you can add it to your server clicking the button above.</p>
